# SFA_Semiparametric_inefficiency
SFA Semiparametric inefficiency

This repository contains the R code used for all calculation in the "Semi-Parametric Modelling of Inefficiencies in Stochastic Frontier Analysis" by Giovanni Forchini and Raoul Theler.


SFA_simulations.R contains the code for the Monte Carlo simulations

The example of application was estimated using a GA procedure and the outcomes are saved in the file data_for_super_computer.RData. The file Bootstrap_application.R relies on these to  bootstrap the various statistics of interest.
